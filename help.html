        <h2>Getting Help During Climate‑Related Events</h2>
        <p>
            People living in poverty are often the most affected by floods, storms, heatwaves, and other climate‑related
            disasters. These resources offer direct support during emergencies:
        </p>


        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local emergency shelters</strong> — safe places to stay during storms or extreme heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Community relief centers</strong> — provide food, water, and essential supplies.</li>
            <li><strong>Disaster assistance programs</strong> — help with evacuation, recovery, and rebuilding.</li>
            <li><strong>Social service agencies</strong> — offer financial support and long‑term stability programs.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            Reaching out early can reduce harm and help families recover faster.

        <h2>How We Can Help Reduce Risk</h2>
        <p>
            SDG Target 1.5 focuses on protecting vulnerable communities by strengthening resilience. These actions help
            reduce exposure to climate‑related extreme events:
        </p>


        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improving early‑warning systems</strong> so families know when danger is coming.</li>
            <li><strong>Supporting stronger housing</strong> that can withstand storms and heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating community emergency plans</strong> with safe routes and shelters.</li>
            <li><strong>Providing education</strong> on disaster preparedness and safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Strengthening access to clean water and food</strong> during emergencies.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            These steps help protect lives and reduce long‑term poverty caused by disasters.
