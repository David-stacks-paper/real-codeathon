        <h2>Understanding SDG Target 1.5</h2>
        <p>
            SDG Target 1.5 focuses on strengthening the resilience of vulnerable populations and reducing their exposure
            to climate‑related extreme events, economic shocks, and social hardships. Communities facing poverty are often
            the most affected by disasters, making resilience a key part of ending poverty in all its forms.

        <h2>Building Resilience by 2030</h2>
        <p>
            Target 1.5 aims to ensure that by 2030, all countries—especially developing regions—build stronger systems
            that protect people from disasters and long‑term risks. This includes improving early‑warning systems,
            investing in climate‑resilient infrastructure, and supporting communities that are most at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            When disasters strike, families living in poverty often lose their homes, income, and access to essential
            services. By strengthening resilience, governments and communities can reduce these impacts and help people
            recover faster. This target highlights the importance of preparedness, sustainable development, and protecting
            human lives from preventable harm.

        <h2>Why Resilience Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Building resilience helps break the cycle of poverty. When communities have strong infrastructure, emergency
            plans, and social support systems, they are better able to withstand crises and rebuild their lives. This is
            essential for achieving long‑term progress toward ending poverty worldwide.
